In the universities, colleges, schools are often form groups with alumni from the same organization. These associations often organize social events, publish newsletters or magazines raise funds for the organization. Many provide a variety of benefits and services that help alumni maintain connections to their educational institution and fellow graduates. Additionally, such groups often support new alumni, and provide a platform to form new friendships and business relationships with people of similar background. Alumni associations are mainly organized around universities or departments of universities but may also be organized among students that studied in a certain country. Today, alumni associations involve graduates of all age groups and demographics.
